# SVD Compression
Singular Value Decomposion-based image compression  
Only works on square images  
Written in Java for my UTD CS 2336 Final Project  
I would have done it in Rust, but it's a Java class :(  
Doing this cause I needed something to do for it, and I'm in MATH 4334 (Numerical Analysis) & we learned about SVD  
`ImageCompression.java` houses the main function
